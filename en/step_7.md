## Challenge: selecting the data to be recorded
--- challenge ---
You might not always want to record all the sensor data. One solution to this is to simply comment out the lines you don't need in your `get_sense_data()` function.

Another solution would be to use **conditional selection**.

- Can you set up your script so that you pass into your `get_sense_data` function the sensors you want to use, and these are then the only ones that are recorded? Don't forget to add a method to alter the header row of your CSV file as well.
